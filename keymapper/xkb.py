"""Handles xkb config files and calls to setxkbmap.

This is optional and can be disabled via the configuration. If disabled,
outputting keys that are unknown to the system layout is impossible.

It is optional because broken xkb configs can crash the X session or screw
up the injection, and in ttys xkb configs don't have any effect.

It uses setxkbmap to tell the window manager to do stuff differently for
the injected keycodes.

workflow:
1. injector preparation sees that "a" maps to "b"
2. check which keycode "b" would usually be
   2.a if not in the system_mapping, this keycode is unknown to the
       window manager and therefore cannot be used. To fix that,
       find an integer code that is not present in system_mapping yet.
   2.b if in the system_mapping, use the existing int code.
3. in the symbols file map that code to "b"
4. the system_mapping gets updated if a free keycode had to be used
5. the injection proceeds to prepare the remaining stuff using the
   updated system_mapping. The newly created key-mapper device gets the
   config files applied using setxkbmap

injection:
1. running injection sees that "a" was clicked on the keyboard
2. the injector knows based on the system_mapping that this maps to
   e.g. 48 (KEY_B) and injects it
3. the window manager sees code 48 and writes a "b" into the focused
   application, because the xkb config tells it to do so

now it is possible to map "รถ" on an US keyboard

Mapping code 10 to a on device_1 and 10 to shift on device_2 may cause issues
when pressing both at the same time, More information can be found in
readme/history.md. That's why the resulting symbols file should match
the existing keyboard layout as much as possible, so that shift stays on the
code that it would usually be.
