"""Handles xkb config files and calls to setxkbmap.

This is optional and can be disabled via the configuration. If disabled,
outputting keys that are unknown to the system layout is impossible.

It uses setxkbmap to tell the window manager to do stuff differently, so
it will not work in ttys, and it won't interact with any other module of
key-mapper.

workflow:
1. injector preparation sees that "a" maps to "b"
2. check which keycode "b" would usually be
   2.1 if not in the system_mapping, find a free code
3. in the symbols file map that code to "b"
4. the system_mapping gets updated if a free keycode had to be used
5. the injection proceeds to prepare the remaining stuff using the
   updated system_mapping. The newly created key-mapper device gets the
   config files applied using setxkbmap

injection:
1. running injection sees that "a" was clicked on the keyboard
2. the injector knows based on the system_mapping that this maps to
   e.g. 48 (KEY_B) and injects it
3. the window manager sees code 48 and writes a "b" into the focused
   application, because the xkb config tells it to do so

now it is possible to map "รถ" on an us keyboard
